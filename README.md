# elm-swapi

This project was created to help learn the Elm language. I'll be recording my experiments and what I've learned while treking through Elm.

This project is a frontend client for the SWAPI (Start Wars API). Basic styling has been implemented leveraging Bootstrap, no CSS pre/post-processors were used.

## Experiments

* [ ] Create basic view with a model.
* [ ] Implement basic DOM events.
* [ ] Import a 3rd party elm package.
* [ ] Create tests and execute on CI/CD platform.
